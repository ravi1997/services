# AI Agent Instructions (Root)

This project contains a comprehensive AI Agent configuration in the `agent/` directory.

## CRITICAL: Discovery
Before taking any action, you MUST:
1. Read `agent/00_INDEX.md` - This is the main router for all tasks.
2. Read `agent/00_SYSTEM.md` - This contains your role and non-negotiable policies.
3. Read `agent/01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - This identifies the technology stack and environment.

## Workflow Integration
- Always route requests through the logic in `agent/00_INDEX.md`.
- Use the specialized checklists in `agent/checklists/` before proposing fixes.
- Follow the quality gates in `agent/gates/` before marking tasks as complete.
- Use the templates in `agent/artifacts/` for all outputs (PRs, reports, etc.).

## Transferability
If you copy the `agent/` folder to a new project, run the auto-setup skill immediately:
`SKILL:PROJECT_AUTO_SETUP` → `agent/skills/project_auto_setup.md`
