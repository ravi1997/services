# Agent Documentation

## Overview
The agent is the central orchestrator for backend integrations, async processing, and service communication. This documentation is optimized for AI-assisted code maintenance and extensibility.

## Responsibilities
- Orchestrate communication between internal modules and external APIs (CDAC, eHospital, mail, SMS).
- Manage async tasks with Celery for scalable background jobs.
- Enforce security, reliability, and robust error handling.
- Centralize logging and monitoring for observability.
- Provide extensible hooks for new integrations and features.

## Advanced Architecture
The agent is designed for modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

| Layer         | Key Functions & Standards                                         |
|-------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API Routes    | RESTful endpoints, input validation, OpenAPI/Swagger support.      |
| Models        | Pydantic/SQLAlchemy models, type safety, schema validation.        |
| Tasks         | Celery tasks, retry logic, distributed processing.                 |
| Utils         | Service connectors, logging, error handling, config management.    |

```

## Integration Points
- **CDAC Service**: SMS gateway integration (`utils/cdac_service.py`).
- **eHospital Service**: Hospital system integration (`utils/ehospital_service.py`).
- **Email Service**: Email sending (`utils/email_service.py`).
- **Logging**: Centralized logging (`utils/logging_utils.py`).
- **Response Formatting**: Standardized API responses (`utils/response.py`).

## Code Snippets & Patterns
### Async Task Example
```python
from app.tasks.sms_tasks import send_sms_task

def trigger_sms(phone, message):
	# Enqueue SMS sending as a background job
	send_sms_task.delay(phone, message)
```

### Logging Example
```python
from app.utils.logging_utils import log_event

def process_event(event):
	log_event(f"Processing event: {event}")
```

### Error Handling Example
```python
from app.utils.response import error_response

def handle_error(e):
	return error_response(str(e), code=500)
```

## AI Guidance for Code Updates
- Keep function and class names descriptive and consistent.
- Add docstrings to all public methods and classes.
- Use type hints for better code analysis and AI understanding.
- Document new integrations and flows in this file.
- Prefer modular, loosely coupled code for easier AI-driven refactoring.


## Best Practices & Standards
- Use environment variables for secrets and configs (never hard-code sensitive data).
- Adhere to PEP8, PEP257 (docstrings), and Python industry standards.
- Write unit, integration, and security tests for all agent logic.
- Use code reviews and static analysis tools (e.g., flake8, mypy, bandit).
- Document all public APIs and modules with OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Prefer dependency injection for testability and flexibility.
- Update this documentation with every major code change.

## Security Parameters & Recommendations
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use HTTPS for all external communications and APIs.
- Store secrets (API keys, passwords) securely using environment variables or secret managers.
- Implement authentication and authorization for all sensitive endpoints (OAuth2, JWT, etc.).
- Log security events and monitor for suspicious activity.
- Apply the principle of least privilege for service accounts and API access.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
- Use secure coding libraries and avoid deprecated or unsafe functions.
- Protect against CSRF, XSS, and other common web vulnerabilities.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
