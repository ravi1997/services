# AI Agent Folder Rules

This folder contains the "Brain" and "Operating System" for AI agents working on this project.

## Instructions
- **Never modify** these files unless explicitly asked to "update agent skills/flows".
- **Reference everything**: Use `REFERENCE_MAP.md` to find the correct tags and files.
- **Stay Universal**: When adding new skills or workflows, avoid hardcoding technological assumptions. Refer to `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for project-specific variables.

## Key Directories
- `artifacts/`: Templates for all agent outputs.
- `flows/`: Decision trees for complex tasks.
- `skills/`: Procedural knowledge and automation scripts.
- `workflows/`: Step-by-step operational guides.
